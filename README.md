**Exciting News: Learning NLP and Building a Text Summarization Model!**

Hi Friends,

I’m thrilled to share that I’m diving into Natural Language Processing (NLP)! In this project, I will outline the essential techniques, functions, and libraries required to build an effective text summarization model using spaCy. 

NLP is an incredible field that enables machines to understand and interpret human language, and text summarization is a crucial application that can help distill information and enhance comprehension. I’m looking forward to exploring how we can leverage spaCy to create a model that efficiently summarizes text while retaining its core message.
